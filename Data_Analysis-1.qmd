##Data Description:

Researchers have inoculated E. coli to 3 different types of flour and subjected them to 3 different types of water activity. They are measuring the Log CFU/g (E. coli_load) at 10 different unequally spaced time points. Overall, they want to know the survival persistence of E. coli.

Note: - 0.35, 0.55 and 0.65 are the levels of water activity.

##Things that we could do-

1.  Descriptive Statistics- To see whether the data set is normally distributed. Upon that, we'll fit our model •Statistical Modeling: • Fit LM or GLM model • Fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to assess the effect of flour type, water activity, and their interaction over time on E. coli load. • Include time as a repeated measure and flour/aw interactions as fixed effects, while replicate (REP) could be a random effect. • Hypothesis Testing: • Investigate the significance of the flour type and water activity on E. coli persistence. • Assess if the interaction between flour type and water activity is significant. What else?

#Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
# Load the dataset first

library(readr)
Data_1 <- read_csv("Data-1.csv")


library(dplyr)
Data_1 %>%
  group_by(Flour) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Ecoli_Load = mean(Ecoli_Load, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Ecoli_Load = sd(Ecoli_Load, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
boxplot(Ecoli_Load ~ Flour, data = Data_1, main="E. coli Load by Flour", xlab="Flour", ylab="E. coli Load")

```
*Interpretation:*
The boxplot shows the E. coli Load by Flour Type across three types of flour: Buck, Cake, and Wheat.

**Buck Flour:**

The median E. coli load is around 5.5.
The interquartile range (IQR) appears to be fairly narrow, indicating that the E. coli load values are relatively concentrated around the median.
There are no obvious outliers.

Cake Flour:

The median E. coli load is higher than for Buck flour, around 6.5.
The IQR is wider compared to Buck flour, indicating more variability in the E. coli load.
There are several outliers at the lower end of the scale, suggesting that some samples had much lower E. coli loads compared to the bulk of the data.
Wheat Flour:

The median E. coli load is lower than both Buck and Cake flours, at approximately 5.
The IQR is wider than for Buck but narrower than for Cake flour.
There are no obvious outliers.

*Overall Interpretation:*

Cake Flour tends to have the highest E. coli load, followed by Buck Flour and Wheat Flour, which has the lowest.
There are significant differences between Wheat Flour and the other two types, indicating that the type of flour likely plays a significant role in the persistence of E. coli.
This visualization supports the results from your Tukey HSD test, showing that Wheat Flour significantly differs from both Cake and Buck in terms of E. coli load

#Anova Test

```{r}
aov_results <- aov(Ecoli_Load ~ Flour, data = Data_1)
summary(aov_results)

```
As, it's significanty, we're running Tukey's HSD


```{r}
TukeyHSD(aov_results)

```
*Interpritation:*

The Tukey HSD test indicates significant differences in E. coli load between Wheat and both Buck and Cake flour types. There is no significant difference between Cake and Buck flour types.


#Pairwise Comparison Plot
```{r}

```

```{r}
# Install and load ggsignif package

library(ggsignif)
library(ggplot2)

# Create the boxplot with Tukey HSD results
ggplot(Data_1, aes(x=Flour, y=Ecoli_Load, fill=Flour)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="E. coli Load by Flour", x="Flour", y="E. coli Load") +
  theme_minimal() +
  stat_summary(
    aes(label = ..y..), 
    fun = mean, 
    geom = "text", 
    vjust = -0.5, 
    size = 3
  ) +
  geom_signif(
    comparisons = list(c("Wheat", "Buck"), c("Wheat", "Cake")),
    map_signif_level = TRUE
  )

```

*Interpretation:*

Wheat flour consistently has a lower E. coli load compared to both Buck and Cake flours, and this difference is statistically significant (as indicated by the asterisks).
The similar means between Buck and Cake suggest that these two flour types have comparable E. coli loads, though Cake flour exhibits more variability and outliers.
This boxplot visually supports the results from the Tukey HSD test, indicating that Wheat flour has a significantly lower E. coli load than both Buck and Cake flours.
This graph effectively highlights the significant effect of flour type on E. coli load in the dataset.

  theme_minimal()

print(lineplot_gg)

```

#QQ Plot: *Interpretation:*

This QQ plot suggests that the distribution of Ecoli_Load departs from normality, particularly in the tails. This might indicate the presence of outliers or a skewed distribution. Depending on the extent of the deviation, you might consider transformations (e.g., log or Box-Cox) or using non-parametric methods if normality is an important assumption for further analysis.

## Line Plot:

This plot shows the E. coli Load (Log CFU/g) over time across different levels of water activity (aw) and replicates (REP). The plot is separated by three panels representing replicates 1, 2, and 3. The x-axis represents Day, while the y-axis represents E. coli Load (Log CFU/g). Different colors are used to represent different levels of water activity (aw) (0.45, 0.55, and 0.65).

Key Observations:
General Trend:

Across all replicates, there is a general decline in E. coli load over time. This indicates that the bacterial load decreases as the number of days increases, which is expected as time progresses during storage or treatment.
Effect of Water Activity (aw):

The red points represent aw = 0.45, green points represent aw = 0.55, and blue points represent aw = 0.65.
Although there is some variability, aw = 0.65 (blue) generally tends to result in a lower E. coli load compared to the lower levels of water activity (0.45 and 0.55). This is especially noticeable toward the end of the time period (Day 90).
This suggests that higher water activity could be associated with more rapid reduction in E. coli load.

Replicate Effects:

There are three replicates (panels labeled 1, 2, and 3), and there seems to be some variation in patterns between replicates. For example:
In Replicate 1, the initial E. coli load is higher, and the decline appears more gradual compared to the other two replicates.
In Replicates 2 and 3, the load starts high but drops sharply around Days 30-60, suggesting a faster reduction in these replicates.
While the overall pattern is similar across replicates, the exact magnitude of reduction and variability differs, indicating some possible random variation or replicate-specific conditions.

Interaction Between Time and Water Activity:

There seems to be a significant interaction between time and aw levels. Over time, the aw = 0.65 condition (blue points) tends to drop more steeply, whereas lower aw levels (0.45 and 0.55) maintain a higher E. coli load for longer periods.
This could suggest that water activity has a substantial effect on the persistence of E. coli and that higher aw values promote faster reductions in bacterial load.

Conclusion:
The plot visually confirms that E. coli load decreases over time, and this decline is influenced by the water activity level. Specifically, higher aw (0.65) appears to lead to a faster decline in E. coli compared to the lower aw levels. Additionally, while there is some variability between the replicates, the overall trend remains consistent across all replicates.

## Fitting Mixed Model
```{r}
library(lme4)
# Fit a mixed model with REP as a random effect
model <- lmer(Ecoli_Load ~ Flour + aw + Day + (1 | REP), data = Data_1)

# Check the summary
summary(model)

```

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
# Fit a mixed model with REP as a random effect
model <- lmer(Ecoli_Load ~ aw + Day + aw * Day + (1 | REP), data = Data_1)

# Check the summary
summary(model)
```

## Interpretation:

Model: Y=

The output from mixed effects model with the interaction term between aw and Day provides the following results:

*Intercept (E. coli load when both aw and Day are zero):* 6.29789 6.29789, highly significant with 𝑝\<0.001 p\<0.001.

*aw (Effect of water activity alone):* 0.18945, not statistically significant with p=0.8241.

*Day (Effect of day alone):*

−0.02417, statistically significant with p=0.0098, indicating that E. coli load decreases over days.

*(Interaction effect between water activity and day):*

−0.01500, not statistically significant with p=0.3701, suggesting the interaction does not significantly affect the E. coli load.

#Conclusions:

Day has a significant negative effect on E. coli load, indicating that as days progress, E. coli load decreases.
The interaction between aw and Day is not significant, implying that the effect of days on E. coli load does not vary by different levels of water activity.

```{r}
# Extract residuals and fitted values
residuals <- resid(model)
fitted_values <- fitted(model)

# Histogram of residuals
hist(residuals, main="Histogram of Residuals", xlab="Residuals")

# Q-Q Plot
qqnorm(residuals)
qqline(residuals, col = "red")

# Shapiro-Wilk Test for normality
shapiro.test(residuals)

```
The histogram and QQ Plot showing that the model following the Assumption. So we can fit this model


#Model Comparison
```{r}
# Fit the model without the interaction term
model_simple <- lmer(Ecoli_Load ~ aw + Day + (1 | REP), data = Data_1)

# Compare the models using ANOVA
anova(model_simple, model)

```
#Interpretation:

Chi-Square Test Statistic: The Chi-Square value (0.8142) measures the difference in fit between the two models.

p-value: The p-value (0.3669) is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05.
Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, you fail to reject the null hypothesis that the simpler model (without the interaction term) is as good as the full model (with the interaction term). This suggests that the interaction term does not significantly improve the fit of the model.

So, we can use the model without the interaction effect.
